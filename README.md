## Introduction
The app connects to a Dash Camera.
Roadvision works as a car black box, dash cam or car DVR cam, keeping to capture videos and photos during your driving. The app automatically records everything, but only important events are retained for future reference or as evidence. You get to choose what to keep, simply by touching the screen, even while you drive.

The video evidence can be invaluable in case of accidents, insurance fraud, police abuse, protection from crash-for-cash scams and differences of opinion with other drivers
